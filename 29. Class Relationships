The relationships among classes define how system components interact with each other:
•	A Customer is associated with one Token
•	A Queue contains multiple Tokens (Aggregation)
•	A ServiceCounter is assigned one Token at a time
•	A Teller operates one or more ServiceCounters
•	An Admin manages ServiceCounters, Tellers, and Reports
•	The Notification class communicates with the Customer
•	The Report class is generated by the Admin
These relationships are represented in the class diagram using association and aggregation relationships.
