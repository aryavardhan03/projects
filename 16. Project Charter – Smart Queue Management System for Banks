Project Title
Smart Queue Management System for Banks

Project Overview
The Smart Queue Management System for Banks is a software-based solution aimed at automating and optimizing customer queue handling inside bank branches. The system replaces traditional physical queues and manual token systems with a digital queue management approach that provides virtual token generation, real-time queue monitoring, and notification alerts. The project focuses on improving customer experience, reducing waiting time, and enhancing operational efficiency for bank staff.

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
•	To reduce customer waiting time in bank branches
•	To eliminate overcrowding caused by physical queues
•	To provide transparency in queue status for customers
•	To assist bank staff in managing queues efficiently
•	To improve service delivery and customer satisfaction
•	To develop a reliable and user-friendly queue management system using software engineering principles

Project Scope
The scope of this project includes the design and development of a Smart Queue Management System that supports:
•	Virtual token generation for bank customers
•	Real-time display of queue status
•	Calling customers in an organized sequence
•	Management of multiple service counters
•	Notification alerts to customers when their turn approaches
•	Administrative monitoring and basic reporting
The system is strictly limited to queue management and does not perform any financial or banking transactions.

Stakeholders
The key stakeholders involved in the project include:
•	Bank Customers – End users who generate tokens and track queue status
•	Bank Tellers / Service Staff – Users who call customers and manage counters
•	Bank Manager / Administrator – System owner responsible for monitoring and control
•	Bank Management – Sponsors interested in service efficiency and customer satisfaction
•	IT Support Team – Responsible for system maintenance and support

Project Deliverables
The major deliverables of the project are:
•	Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document
•	Use Case Diagrams
•	Class Diagram
•	Sequence Diagrams
•	Activity Diagrams
•	Component Diagram
•	Deployment Diagram
•	System Design Document
•	Final Mini Project Report

Assumptions
•	Bank branches have basic digital infrastructure such as computers and display screens
•	Users have basic knowledge of using digital systems
•	Internet connectivity is available during bank working hours
•	The system is used only for queue management purposes

Constraints
•	The system does not integrate with core banking systems
•	Financial transactions are outside the project scope
•	The system must comply with basic security and privacy policies
•	Project development is limited to the academic timeline

Risks
•	Network connectivity issues may affect real-time updates
•	Resistance to adoption by staff unfamiliar with digital systems
•	Limited scalability due to academic project constraints

Project Timeline (High-Level)
•	Requirement Analysis & SRS: Week 1–2
•	System Design & Diagrams: Week 3–4
•	Documentation & Review: Week 5
•	Final Submission: Week 6
