Project Title : Smart Queue Management System for Banks
Problem Description:
Banks experience a high volume of customers daily for services such as cash deposits, withdrawals, account inquiries, and form submissions. Most banks still follow traditional queue systems where customers wait in long physical lines or rely on manual token distribution. This leads to overcrowding, increased waiting time, lack of transparency about queue status, and customer frustration. Customers are often unaware of their position in the queue or the expected waiting time. During peak hours, bank staff also find it difficult to manage queues efficiently, resulting in service delays and reduced productivity.
Proposed Solution:
The proposed Smart Queue Management System for Banks is a digital system designed to automate and optimize the queue handling process. The system allows customers to generate virtual tokens, view real-time queue status, and receive notifications when their turn is approaching. Bank tellers can easily call the next customer, while administrators can manage service counters and monitor queue flow through a centralized dashboard. This system minimizes physical crowding, ensures organized service delivery, and improves overall operational efficiency within bank branches.
Target Users:
•	Bank Customers: To receive faster service with reduced waiting time and better transparency.
•	Bank Tellers/Staff: To manage customer flow efficiently and reduce manual effort.
•	Bank Managers/Admin: To monitor queue performance, manage counters, and improve service quality.
Value Proposition:
The Smart Queue Management System adds significant value by reducing customer waiting time, improving service efficiency, and enhancing customer satisfaction in banks. It enables better utilization of staff, provides transparency in queue operations, and supports data-driven decision-making for bank management. By replacing manual queue systems with an automated solution, banks can deliver faster, more organized, and customer-friendly services.
