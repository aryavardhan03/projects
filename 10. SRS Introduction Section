2 Scope	
The Smart Queue Management System for Banks is designed to automate and manage customer queues within bank branches. The system provides virtual token generation, real-time queue tracking, counter management, and notifications to improve service efficiency and reduce customer waiting time. The system does not perform banking transactions and is limited strictly to queue management operations inside bank premises.
