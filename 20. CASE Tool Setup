For the design phase of the Smart Queue Management System for Banks, a Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool was selected to create and manage system diagrams efficiently.
Selected CASE Tool: StarUML
StarUML was installed and configured on the development system to support UML-based modeling. The tool is used to design various diagrams such as use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams.
The CASE tool enables:
•	Standard UML notation
•	Clear visualization of system design
•	Easy modification and version control of diagrams
•	Improved understanding of system architecture
The successful installation and configuration of the CASE tool ensures a structured and systematic approach to system design.
