The design document explains the architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Smart Queue Management System for Banks. The system is designed using a modular and layered approach to improve maintainability, clarity, and scalability.
Design Decisions
•	A modular architecture is used to separate queue management, token handling, notification, and reporting.
•	UML diagrams are used to visually represent system structure and behavior.
•	Security is handled through role-based authentication for staff and administrators.
•	The database is centralized to maintain data consistency and integrity.
Assumptions
•	The system is deployed within bank premises.
•	Users have basic digital literacy.
•	Internet or local network connectivity is available during working hours.
Limitations
•	The system does not support financial transactions.
•	Advanced analytics and AI-based predictions are not included.
•	Integration with core banking systems is not supported.
Scalability Considerations
•	The system can be extended to support multiple bank branches.
•	Additional service counters can be added easily.
•	Notification methods can be expanded (SMS, email, display alerts).
This design ensures that the Smart Queue Management System for Banks meets functional requirements while remaining simple, reliable, and suitable for academic implementation.
